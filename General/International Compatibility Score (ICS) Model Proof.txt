International Compatibility Score (ICS) Model Proof

Given the mathematical model outlined, we will verify the correctness of each step involved in calculating the International Compatibility Score (ICS). The steps include defining dimensions and indicators, standardizing the indicators, aggregating the indicators, calculating the overall compatibility score, and analyzing the scores.

1. Defining Dimensions and Indicators

We define the following dimensions with their respective indicators:

- Political Factors (P):
  - International agreements participation
  - Political stability index
  - Corruption perception index

- Economic Factors (E):
  - GDP per capita
  - Trade openness index
  - Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows

- Social Factors (S):
  - Education index
  - Healthcare quality index
  - Human development index (HDI)

- Cultural Factors (C):
  - Cultural proximity index
  - Language similarity index
  - Cross-cultural communication adaptability

- Environmental Factors (Env):
  - Environmental performance index
  - Carbon footprint per capita
  - Renewable energy usage percentage

2. Standardizing the Indicators

Each indicator is standardized to a common scale (0 to 100) using the formula:

  Standardized Value = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min) * 100

where X is the raw value, X_min and X_max are the minimum and maximum values in the dataset.

For Australia, the standardized values are assumed to be:

- Political Factors (P):
  - International agreements participation: 90
  - Political stability index: 85
  - Corruption perception index: 80

- Economic Factors (E):
  - GDP per capita: 88
  - Trade openness index: 92
  - FDI inflows: 85

- Social Factors (S):
  - Education index: 90
  - Healthcare quality index: 88
  - Human development index: 95

- Cultural Factors (C):
  - Cultural proximity index: 75
  - Language similarity index: 90
  - Cross-cultural communication adaptability: 85

- Environmental Factors (Env):
  - Environmental performance index: 70
  - Carbon footprint per capita: 50
  - Renewable energy usage percentage: 65

3. Aggregating the Indicators

The standardized indicators are aggregated to compute composite scores for each dimension using a weighted average. The composite scores are calculated as:

  P_i = sum(w_pj * Standardized Value_pj)
  E_i = sum(w_ej * Standardized Value_ej)
  S_i = sum(w_sj * Standardized Value_sj)
  C_i = sum(w_cj * Standardized Value_cj)
  Env_i = sum(w_envj * Standardized Value_envj)

For Australia:
- Political Factors (P):
  P_i = (90 + 85 + 80) / 3 = 85

- Economic Factors (E):
  E_i = (88 + 92 + 85) / 3 = 88.33

- Social Factors (S):
  S_i = (90 + 88 + 95) / 3 = 91

- Cultural Factors (C):
  C_i = (75 + 90 + 85) / 3 = 83.33

- Environmental Factors (Env):
  Env_i = (70 + 50 + 65) / 3 = 61.67

4. Calculating the Overall Compatibility Score

The overall international compatibility score (ICS) is calculated by combining the composite scores of all dimensions:

  ICS_i = w_p * P_i + w_e * E_i + w_s * S_i + w_c * C_i + w_env * Env_i

Assuming weights:

  w_p = 0.2
  w_e = 0.25
  w_s = 0.2
  w_c = 0.15
  w_env = 0.2

The overall compatibility score for Australia is calculated as:

  ICS_i = 0.2 * 85 + 0.25 * 88.33 + 0.2 * 91 + 0.15 * 83.33 + 0.2 * 61.67
  ICS_i = 17 + 22.0825 + 18.2 + 12.4995 + 12.334
  ICS_i = 82.116

5. Interpretation

The proof verifies that each step in the mathematical model is correctly formulated and calculated. An ICS of 82.116 indicates a high international compatibility score for Australia, reflecting strong potential for international cooperation and smooth interactions.

Conclusion

The ICS provides a comprehensive measure of international compatibility by integrating multiple dimensions and their respective indicators.
