> Measuring all 195 countries on Earth for direct relationships, similarities and divides.

The International Compatibility Project is designed to analyze and understand the dynamics of international relations by examining various factors that contribute to the compatibility and cooperation between different countries. This project aims to provide insights into how nations interact, the sentiment of their relations, key players in international networks, and the historical context of their relationships. By leveraging a combination of data collection methods and advanced analytical techniques, we strive to identify patterns, trends, and significant factors influencing international compatibility.

"International Compatibility" is measured through a comprehensive methodology that considers various dimensions such as political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental factors. It involves quantitative data analysis and qualitative assessments, integrating indicators from international databases and expert insights to evaluate and compare the relationships between countries. The goal is to identify similarities and divides among nations to better understand how they can interact and cooperate on the global stage.

A mathematical model for calculating "International Compatibility" was developed by integrating quantitative data analysis and qualitative assessments across multiple dimensions: political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental factors. The International Compatibility Score (ICS) is a composite measure designed to evaluate the extent to which a country is compatible with other nations in terms of political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental dimensions. The score provides a quantitative assessment that helps to identify similarities and divides among countries, thereby facilitating better understanding and cooperation on the global stage.
