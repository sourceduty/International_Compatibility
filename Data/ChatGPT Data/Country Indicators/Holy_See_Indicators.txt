It plays a significant role in global diplomatic relations, focusing on human rights, peace, and environmental issues.

3. Corruption perception index: There is no specific Corruption Perceptions Index score for the Holy See, but it maintains strict governance and financial regulations within its institutions to ensure transparency and accountability.

Economic Factors (E)

1. GDP per capita: The Holy See does not report GDP per capita in the conventional sense, as its economy is unique, primarily supported by contributions from the global Catholic community, investments, and revenue from the Vatican Museums.

It does not have a specific healthcare quality index but is known for its contributions to global health initiatives.
