- International Agreements Participation: North Korea is known for its limited participation in international agreements. It has joined a few treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but its overall engagement is minimal and often contentious.
- Political Stability Index: North Korea does not have a published Political Stability Index. However, the regime maintains strict control over the population through authoritarian rule, significant military presence, and severe restrictions on freedoms.
- Corruption Perception Index: Transparency International does not publish a Corruption Perception Index for North Korea. Nevertheless, corruption is reportedly pervasive, with power and resources concentrated in the hands of the elite and widespread bribery at all levels of society.

Economic Factors (E)

- GDP per Capita: North Korea's GDP per capita is estimated to be very low, around $1,700 according to the CIA World Factbook.

- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Inflows: FDI in North Korea is minimal due to its isolationist policies and international sanctions. Most foreign investments come through Chinese partnerships in special economic zones.

Social Factors (S)

- Education Index: North Korea's education system is state-controlled, with a focus on ideological indoctrination. Accurate metrics for the Education Index are unavailable, but education quality is generally considered poor due to limited resources and infrastructure.
